    <h3>About the Piece</h3>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
        The theme of the piece is self-love. Oftentimes, people get caught up comparing their lives to the lives of others. <br>
        In doing so, they lose sight of all the blessings that surround them. The words portrayed on the screen, <br>
        "No such thing as a life that's better than yourz" are lyrics from a song called "Love Yourz," written by rapper J Cole. <br>
        It is also centered around the theme of self-love, especially in the age of technology, where it is so easy to compare <br>
        oneself to others.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
        I made several design choices to best portray self-love. I made every word besides "YOURZ" lowercase to <br>
        emphasize the importance of enjoying ones own life. The word "YOURZ" is also generated in a random color, <br>
        while all the other words are white in order to show how everyone's life is different and to highlight the <br>
        beauty in that difference. There is a delay between each of the words appearing to mimick the rythym of singing <br>
        the lyrics, and the lyrics are spread across four displays: one each for the groups "no such thing", "as a thing",<br>
        "thats better than", and "YOURZ." I sepearated this text to both make sure that the text was large enough to <br>
        easily read and to represent cyclical nature of the four seasons. Similar to the seasons, life will have its <br>
        its ups and downs and there's beauty in the resilience to make it through the cycle.

    <h3>Setup</h3>
    <p>
        Creating the exhibit requires a couple of steps. The first is to download the Arduino software, in my case, <br>
        I needed to download the Legacy version, an older version of the software. Once it is downloaded and running, <br>
        go to file->preferences and then enable the esp32 board by inserting this url where it says additional boards manager: <br>
        https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json <br>

        Then go to Tools->Boards->ESP32 Arduino and select TTGO T1. In order to select a port, make sure that the ESP32 <br>
        is connected to the your machine using a data transfer USB-C cable. In my case, I needed to download the following driver <br>
        and reset my machine in order to get the code to load on my ESP32. <br>
        http://www.wch.cn/downloads/CH34XSER_MAC_ZIP.html <br>
        For those that also need to download the driver, select the port /dev/cu.wchusbserial.<br>

        It is also required to install the TFT_eSPI library by Bodmer. This can be done by going to Tools->Library Manager. <br>

        Once all of the prepation is done, you can upload the code found in Love_Yourz.ino to the ESP32. The file can be <br>
        found in the following Git Repository: <br>
